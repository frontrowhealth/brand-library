        I know a lot of you now have kids that are teenagers, so I’m sharing this because it’s a critical resource designed for teens to help them manage their health before onset of more serious chronic conditions. For example, Thread Health understands that as a teen, your child may have questions or concerns about their health that they might not feel comfortable discussing face-to-face with a doctor. Here, they can text a trained adolescent specialist and talk about sensitive topics like sexual or mental health — things that aren’t discussed enough at an early age with people who are clinically trained to address these issues.

      <div className="fr-review-text">
        As a conventional medical doctor, I can tell you first hand that we do not receive enough training on how to manage the health of teens — I’ve had two teenagers myself, and they simply face different challenges that need to be handled more sensitively. What’s nice about Thread and why I’m excited to share it with you is that imagine your teenager wakes up feeling unwell or has questions about their mental health. With Thread Health, they can reach out discreetly to a trained adolescent specialist, without the need for an in-person visit. It's like having a healthcare lifeline for your teenager, available at any time — a reassuring safety net for both you and your child.
