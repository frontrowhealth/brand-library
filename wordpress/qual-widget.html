      This data-driven approach is pretty rare to see, and it really allows Midday to offer personalized recommendations to you all.

    <div class="fr-review-text">
      I’m very impressed with the level of thoughtfulness this app offers. It was developed by experts who know far more clinically about Menopause than myself (looks like it was made through a collaboration Mayo Clinic and SRI International, two extremely reputable organizations). Midday also seems to go beyond just providing information; it also empowers you to track your symptoms and access a wide range of evidence-based therapeutic options. You can effortlessly monitor symptoms like hot flashes and sleep disturbances using wearable technology and AI. This data-driven approach is pretty rare to see, and it really allows Midday to offer personalized recommendations to you all.

    <div class="fr-review-text">
      As a woman going through Menopause myself, Midday’s level of personalization is really great for you all who are also in a similar stage of life. Menopause is truly different for every person / patient, and Midday does a nice job of first assessing your unique physical and emotional wellbeing to offer you personalized insights, recommendations, and guided programs to address your specific symptoms. There’s just honestly way more resources offered to you through Midday than any single medical provider like myself can give you: coaching, symptom tracking, insights from data collected through wearables, etc.
