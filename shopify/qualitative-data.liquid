      I always recommend Omega 3 to you all (multiple health benefits from skincare, joint health, etc.), but unlike many Omega products with a one-to-one ratio of DHA to EPA, this ‘extra strength’ supplement stands out because of its more optimal ratio between EPA:DHA.

      Omega-3 and omega-6 are two types of fats that our body needs, but they have to be in the right balance to work well. In many modern diets, we get too much omega-6 and not enough omega-3. I like to recommend taking omega-3 supplements like this one because there’s an anti-inflammatory effect that stops the overproduction of omega-6. This will ultimately keep your eyes healthier (basically less cell damage).
