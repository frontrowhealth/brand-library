    <p>We’ve partnered with Frontrow Health who works with hundreds of medical providers and tracks which non-prescription products they share with real patients and why they choose to do so.</p>
    <p>How it works: Frontrow Health enables providers to share their favorite health products through their own 'discounts pages'. Providers share these pages with patients without getting paid, and Frontrow pays patients cash back when they buy.
    </p>
    <p>Frontrow tracks data on which products providers include on their page, and if they add any notes to their patients about why, and then shares this data back with health brands like us.
