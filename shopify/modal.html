    <p>We’ve partnered with Frontrow Health who works with hundreds of medical providers and tracks which non-prescription products they share with real patients.</p>
    <p>This number represents how many of Frontrow Health’s medical providers (unaffiliated without our brand) have recently shared this product to benefit their own patients!</p>
    <p>
      <span class="modal-note">Note: these providers do not receive compensation for sharing these products. </span>
