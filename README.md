# brand-library

This project provides sample code for the Frontrow widgets that can be included on brand partners' websites.

Widgets:
1. Quantitative -- shows the number of providers that shared a product on their Frontrow page
2. Qualitative -- shows real reviews from providers that shared a product and details on how data is collected

If you only want to use the quantitative data, refer to the code and documentation in [this link](https://github.com/frontrowhealth/brand-library/tree/widget-v1) instead.

Additional details provided in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZhBG_1hGyUHoUMWNK-WXQBhqlTAjJpPaZHuGKhPCcU/edit?usp=sharing) including:
- How to create a temporary editor user
- Context on widgets

**Most CMSs (Shopify, Wordpress, Wix, etc.) can have a temporary editor user. Then our team can do the implementation! We would never publish to your live site, we can make the changes for you to review and you can publish them.**

The sample-screenshots folder in this project shows the widgets in the context of the different platforms code is provided for.

The quantitative data widget has sample code for:
- HTML & CSS
- ReactJS with CSS or tailwind
- Shopify
- Framer
- Wordpress (with elementor plugin)

The qualitative data widget has sample code for:
- HTML & CSS
- Shopify

**Mobile & desktop versions**

All versions account for differences between the desktop and mobile experiences. There are slight styling and copy changes between the 2 versions so it's important to include all code for whichever version is being used.

*Feel free to make changes to the styling and/or copy for both mobile and desktop. The code provided tested well on user tests done by Frontrow's design team.


## HTML (Quant & Qual)

`./html` has a code snippet for the quantitative data. Put this code near the title or star rating for your product. Copy the css into the designated area for your site.

The qualitative data snippet is also provided in `./html`. Put this snippet at the bottom of your site. The link in the first widget will link to the reviews section. Be sure to copy the qualitative widget css into your site too.

#### Add access to font awesome icons
In the `<head>` section of your site, paste the following line of code:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```

## Shopify (Quant & Qual)

A screen recording of a sample store is provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhIiP2j2PWJWd7DxZWMQXHsrAtLA3U8X/view?usp=sharing) and in the Google Doc linked at the top of this document. (This only sets up the quantitative data widget.)

**Create a copy of your theme if you want to edit without affecting the live site. When all changes are done, the copied theme can be published.**

In order to add the custom widget to a shopify store, follow these steps:

#### Add quantitative code snippet to product details page
1. Navigate to the "Online Store" section in the left hand navigation.
1. On the themes page, select the three dots icon and go to "Edit Code".
1. In the left hand navigation, find the section called snippets and click "Add a new snippet"
1. Name the file `frontrow-widget.liquid`, enter just `frontrow-widget` in the file name input box.
1. Copy and paste the code from `./shopify/frontrow-widget.liquid` from this project into your new file in Shopify. Save.
1. At this point you can also change the background color or other styles to match your own branding.
    - **Be sure to also change the provider count as needed.**
    - *Use the code in `./shopify/frontrow-widget-with-metafield.liquid` if you have a metafield for the provider count.*
1. Go back to the file directory on the left hand side of the page and search for `product.liquid`. You are looking for the main product page for your Shopify site. This file could be named `mainâ€“product.liquid`, `product.liquid`, or `product-template.liquid`.
1. Scroll down until you find the section above where you want the frontrow widget to be. For example, in the screen recording I found the 'title' section. Just below the section (likely ending in `</div>`)
1. Add this code snippet: `{% include 'frontrow-widget' %}`. This will include the widget in all product details pages where there is a value for the metafield we added at the beginning. Save the file.
    - The snippet will be included in all product pages if you don't use a metafield.
    - Refer to the documentation in [this link](https://github.com/frontrowhealth/brand-library/tree/widget-v1) if you need to add a metafield.

#### Add access to font awesome icons
The qualitative data widget includes a free icon from Font Awesome.
1. In the code editor for your site, find the file `theme.liquid`. This should contain a `<head>` section.
1. In that section, paste the following line of code:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```


#### Add qualitative code snippet to product details page
1. Go to "Customize" the site. And navigate to the desired product page.
1. Click in the visual editor where you want to add the qualitative data widget, likely just above the site footer. Select "Custom liquid".
1. Copy the code from `./shopify/qualitative-data.liquid` into a new file on your desktop. Find the TODOs in the file and input the proper values.
    - *You can use the code in `./shopify/qualitative-data-with-metafield.liquid` if you have a metafield for the provider count.*
    - Provider count
    - Reviewer location & date (repeat for second review)
    - Review title & description (repeat for second review)
1. At this point you can also change the background color or other styles to match your own branding. Fonts will automatically match your global font.
1. If you have more than 2 reviews, copy the section with `class="fr-review-container"` and paste below the other `class="fr-review-container"`s. Make sure to input the right data again.
1. Copy your edited version of the snippet into the shopify editor "Custom liquid" section.
1. Save and preview. Test that the link in the quantitative data snippet goes to the reviews section.
    - *If you created a copy of your theme, you can now publish it from the shopify dashboard.*


## Wix

Please reach out to get more guidance how to implement this widget on a wix site. We haven't yet found a good way to share code snippets for wix.

Temporary edit access can be provided to a Frontrow engineer to make the changes themselves if that is preferred by the client.

## React (Quant only)

1. Copy the component from `./react/widget.js` or `./react/widget-with-tailwind.js` depending on if you use tailwind or not.
1. If you're not using tailwind, copy the styles from `./react/widget.css` into the desired stylesheet.


## Framer (Quant only)

1. Add the provided copy to your site where you want the widget to be.
2. In the side panel:
    - Make the number and "medical providers" copy bold
    - Make the number a different color, a non-black brand color is perfect
3. Create an override for the text section by selecting Code Override in the side panel
4. Create a new file called frontrow and paste the contents of `framer/frontrow.tsx` into the new file, making sure to delete the default code that was created upon creating the file
5. Back in the editor, select the new file and the function `someCssOverride`
    - This override file will add the tile behind the text. Feel free to change the `background` property in that file to match your brand colors
6. Save a preview by publishing a preview or pressing the "play" button in the top right hand corner
7. Repeat these steps and reuse the override file & function if you have the widget on any other pages

## Wordpress (with elementor; Quant only)

1. In the elementor editor, click to add a new section where you want the snippet to be.
2. Search for html in the elements panel
3. Select the html type
4. Copy the code from `./wordpress/widget.html` in the code section
5. In the next tab, Advanced, scroll to the bottom and select "Custom CSS"
6. Copy the code from `./wordpress/widget.css` in the code section
7. You should see the widget as intended. Feel free to change colors to match your own branding at this point.
    - You can also drag and drop the widget to another spot on the page if you need.
