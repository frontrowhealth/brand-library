    <div class="fr-review-text">
      As a Gastroenterologist in my 30+ years of practice, there honestly just haven’t been many solutions at all for my patients struggling with IBS/IBD. Ayble is one-of-a-kind from what I’ve seen. I really like how they provide you with a personalized nutrition program that helps you identify your unique trigger foods. This is crucial for managing IBS/IBD, as what triggers symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. By tailoring your nutrition plan to your specific needs, Ayble empowers you to find and remove these trigger foods, leading to significant relief and improved gut health.

    </div>

    <div class="fr-review-text">
      I’m always interested in reviewing data before recommending anything to you. From what I’ve reviewed, Ayble's effectiveness is backed by very strong clinical evidence. Their research shows that 81% of IBS and IBD patients significantly improved their symptoms by using Ayble (this is really impressive given there’s not many effective solutions for IBS at all), with 68% achieving complete symptom resolution by the end of their program. These findings are reported in peer-reviewed publications in leading clinical journals, such as Gastroenterology, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, and Clinical & Translational Gastroenterology (peer-reviewed is the gold standard).
