      What many of my patients over the years have misunderstood about pregnancy is that a healthy pregnancy isn't just about reproductive health; it's about your overall health. Doveras is comprehensive, that’s why I like this for you all. It helps you make positive changes in your diet and lifestyle, manage stress, how to collaborate with your partner, etc., setting the stage for a successful pregnancy journey. This program ensures that you're in the best possible health before conception, which can reduce pregnancy complications, and lead to a healthier baby.
