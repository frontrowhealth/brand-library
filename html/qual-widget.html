    <div class="fr-review-text">
      After review of the data, when compared to established lab standards and reader devices, Oova consistently provides precise LH and PdG measurements. This accuracy is a key factor in understanding your hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle, and it’s why I think this is great for my patients looking to best track their fertile window.

      Making sure patients accurately interpret the results of their fertility test is easier said than done. I’ve found that this device should be very easy to use and to interpret, making it a convenient choice for fertility tracking. It’s also very accurate, and the data shows that in some cases, it’s even shown the potential to replace traditional lab work for hormone trend monitoring, which is exceptional for a product like this.
