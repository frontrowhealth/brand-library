    <div class="fr-review-text">
      Clinical data has linked the consumption of various nutrients included in this vitamin, ω-3 fatty acids, and carotenoids (like lutein and zeaxanthin), to a reduced risk of age-related eye diseases. In other words, this product is well-formulated to prevent eye disease, which I know we don’t talk about a lot but can be quite serious and important to stay on top of.

    <div class="fr-review-text">
      I like this formulation for you all because it’s specifically designed to reduce inflammation and oxidation, which are factors that can contribute to various health issues, including those related to the eyes, which are often lower priority for you all until they become more severe and harder to treat. These ingredients are also not “out there” (some of you have asked me about questionable ingredients before so I know this is top of mind) — Cornea Care has thoughtfully selected safe and commonly used ingredients here.
