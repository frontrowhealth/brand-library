## Doveras setup

### Quantitative data
Update the quantitative widget to match what is in `/react/quant-data-widget-tailwind.js`
- The link goes to the provider testimonial section instead of linking out to Frontrow's site (and the text for that link is updated)


### Provider reviews section

At the bottom of both the IVF and Prepregnancy product pages, add a component for the provider reviews. As of 10/18 the provider count and quotes for both products are the same.

You can use the component in `/react/qual-data-widget-tailwind.js`

The styling should be closely matched to Doveras's site as a whole but feel free to change any styling as you see fit.


### CSS

If you prefer to use a css file instead of tailwind, refer to the files without the `-tailwind` suffix and the `qualt-widget.css` file.

Make sure to update the link and copy of the link the quantitative widget.
