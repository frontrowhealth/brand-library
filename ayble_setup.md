## Ayble health setup - Qual v2 and Quant data

New HTML sections can be added by going to the + icon in the top left, finding the "Advanced" section and selected "Embed". This element can be drag and dropped into the correct location.

Add quant widget below the hero, inside the section with the header "We build you a personalized plan for a happier, healthier gut - based on science"
- `html/quant-widget.html`

Add the qual widget just above the site footer in its own section
- `html/qual-widget.html`

If styles don't work directly in the html embed, follow these steps:
- Add all styles code to the `<head>` section of the site. This setting can be found by going to webflow icon in the top left and selecting "Site settings". Select "Custom code" from the left side navigation menu.

Test and preview the site.
